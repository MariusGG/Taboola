  Taboola Widget
</h1>
It's a simple responsive Taboola widget for desktop and a tablet.
For reference, you can see a live responsive Taboola widget at the bottom of the article on this page: https://www.laprovence.com/article/economie/5463283/les-projets-novateurs-des-jeunes-entrepreneurs-marseillais.html

IMPORTANT: <br>
*You can only use pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and display the widget. Do not use any external libraries (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap).*

### User Stories
I created the following user stories: <br>

`To view the widget on my desktop or tablet,
I would like widgets to display as three columns and two rows (3x2).` <br>

`To identify different widgets,
I want each item to contain a title and branding below each image.` <br>

`To view widgets on my mobile,
I would like widgets to display as a column with six rows (1x6).`<br>

`To access the a widget,
I would like the image, title and branding text to be clickable links that load the url.`<br>
